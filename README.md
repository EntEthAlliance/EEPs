# EEPs
Enterprise Ethereum Proposals (EEPs) describe the standards for Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. EEPs are inspired by [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs). Read [EEP0001 Proposal Process](draft/process/EEP0001-Proposal_Process.md) to get started.

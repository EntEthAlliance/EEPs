# EEPs
Enterprise Ethereum Proposals (EEPs) describe the standards for Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. EEPs are inspired by [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).

# Contributing
First review [EEP-1](draft/EEP-1.md). Then clone the repository and add your EEP to it. There is a [template EEP here](draft/EEP-2.md). Then submit a Pull Request to EntEthAlliance's [EEPs repository](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/EEPs).

# EEP status folders
* **Draft** - an EEP that is open for consideration
* **Accepted** - an EEP that is planned for immediate adoption, i.e. expected to be included in the next hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer EEPs).
* **Final** - an EEP that has been adopted in a previous hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer EEPs).
* **Deferred** - an EIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.

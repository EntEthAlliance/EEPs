# Vision Statement

The CCA working group has a vision of creating a standard for the provision, control and recording of Financial Communication Services. 

# Mission Statement

The CCA working group is a collective of banks and solution providers looking to create a set of standards for banks seamlessly interconnect with one another in the knowledge that compliance regulations are being met. Our approach is to create a set of working cases across the communication lifecylce tackling common issues the first two are:  1. The normalisation of Call Data Records across the plethera of CDR sources. 2. The creation of a standard to enable third party applications to setup and control dynamic interconnects in a manner that decentralises the communication flow whilst ensuring all legs are recorded into the common ledger.

# Motivation

The proliferation of communication channels across the enterprise coupled with the tighter regulations across Financial Services is making it harder and more costly for firms to leverage the latest in technology whilst remaining compliant. The purpose of the working group it to help define a standard for the adoption of communication services such that the compliance is built into the service in an open and normalised manner to ease the integration with third party services. 

# Assumptions

TBC

# Deliverables

The deliverable will be a set of EEP standard documents defining how how to provision interconnects between parties, how to allocate access to interconnects in order to build applications, how to record any data records such as Call Data Records and finally a decision on where and how to store and link to further data such as Voice Recordings. 
A fully functioning system is proposed delivering different use cases enabling the communication between bankng parties and the integration of services from solution providers.
